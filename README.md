## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: This package manager comes bundled with Node.js. You can verify your installation by running `npm -v` in your terminal.
- **Git**: Used for version control. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-github-repo-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```
    *(Replace `<your-github-repo-url>` with the actual URL of your GitHub repository and `<repository-name>` with the name of the cloned directory.)*

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    This command will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

3.  **Create required files:**
    -   **`.env` file (Optional):** If you plan to use environment variables for configuration, create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. You can define your environment-specific variables in this file.
    -   **Configuration files:** Ensure that all necessary configuration files for the application are present in the repository. These should typically be included in the project structure.

4.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This command will start the development server. You should see output in your terminal indicating the server has started.

5.  **Access the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The application should now be running.
